### Quiz Logic
```typescript
// State management
const [currentQuestion, setCurrentQuestion] = useState(0)
const [selectedAnswers, setSelectedAnswers] = useState<(number | null)[]>(Array(20).fill(null))
const [showResults, setShowResults] = useState(false)
const [userName, setUserName] = useState('')

// Score calculation
const calculateScore = () => {
  let correct = 0
  selectedAnswers.forEach((answer, index) => {
    if (answer === quizQuestions[index].correctAnswer) {
      correct++
    }
  })
  return correct
}

// Pass threshold: 70%
const passed = percentage >= 70
```

### Certificate Generation

const downloadPDF = async () => {
  const { jsPDF } = await import('jspdf')
  const doc = new jsPDF({
    orientation: 'landscape',
    unit: 'mm',
